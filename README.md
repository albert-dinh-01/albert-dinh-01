Hello! I am a Computer Software Engineering undergraduate at the University of Alberta. I enjoy learning new software technologies. Outside of software programming, I learn about physics.

I list some projects that are live:

Physics Simulation: https://ad-physics-simulation.herokuapp.com

My personal site: https://albertdinh.com
