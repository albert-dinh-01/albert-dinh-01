Hello! I am a Computer Software Engineering undergraduate at the University of Alberta. I enjoy learning new software technologies. Outside of software programming, I care about physics. In my free time, I either read, watch hockey, run or work out in the gym. Go Oilers go!

Here are some projects I built:

* Physics Simulation: https://ad-physics-simulation.herokuapp.com
* My personal site: https://albertdinh.com
* String Comparison: https://main.d3lkyfv1j58ptq.amplifyapp.com/
